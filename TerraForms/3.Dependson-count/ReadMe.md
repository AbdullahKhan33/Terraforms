 Both `depends_on` and `count` are meta-arguments in Terraform that allow for additional control over resource behaviors.

1. **`depends_on`**: Specifies hidden dependencies. It's a way of explicitly specifying that one resource depends on another.

2. **`count`**: Allows you to create multiple instances of a particular resource.

Here's an example using both of these meta-arguments:

Imagine you want to create multiple storage accounts, and then, after all of them are created, create a virtual network.

**main.tf**:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

# Create multiple storage accounts using count
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  count               = 3  # This creates 3 storage accounts
  name                = "storageacct${count.index}"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier        = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

# Create a virtual network that depends on all storage accounts
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-network"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]

  # Depends on ensures this resource is created after all storage accounts
  depends_on          = [azurerm_storage_account.example]
}
```

In this example:

- We're using `count` in the `azurerm_storage_account` resource to create 3 storage accounts. Their names will be `storageacct0`, `storageacct1`, and `storageacct2` due to `${count.index}`.

- The `azurerm_virtual_network` resource uses `depends_on` to explicitly state that it should only be created after all the storage accounts are created.
