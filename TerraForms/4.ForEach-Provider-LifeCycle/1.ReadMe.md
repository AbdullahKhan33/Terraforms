In the Terraform example provided earlier, the `for_each` meta-argument was used with a map to iterate over the `resource_groups` variable. The map's structure is:

```hcl
variable "resource_groups" {
  description = "A map of resource group names and their respective locations"
  default = {
    rg1 = "East US",
    rg2 = "West US",
    rg3 = "West Europe"
  }
}
```

Each key-value pair in this map represents a resource group name (the key) and its location (the value). 

Now, when you're inside the `azurerm_resource_group.example` resource block and iterating over this map with `for_each`, you can access:

- `each.key` to get the current key (in this context, the name of the resource group).
- `each.value` to get the corresponding value (in this context, the location of the resource group).

This is visualized as:

- For the first iteration: `each.key` would be `"rg1"` and `each.value` would be `"East US"`.
- For the second iteration: `each.key` would be `"rg2"` and `each.value` would be `"West US"`.
- For the third iteration: `each.key` would be `"rg3"` and `each.value` would be `"West Europe"`.

So in the resource block:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  for_each = var.resource_groups

  name     = each.key   # This will be rg1, rg2, rg3 for each respective iteration
  location = each.value # This will be "East US", "West US", "West Europe" for each respective iteration

  ...
}
```

For each iteration:

- `name` will be set to the current map key (i.e., the resource group name).
- `location` will be set to the corresponding map value (i.e., the location for that resource group).

In other words, three resource groups will be created:

1. A resource group named "rg1" in "East US".
2. A resource group named "rg2" in "West US".
3. A resource group named "rg3" in "West Europe".
