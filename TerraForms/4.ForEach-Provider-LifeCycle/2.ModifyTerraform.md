If you've set `prevent_destroy = true` in the `lifecycle` block, Terraform will not allow you to destroy the resource. If you attempt to do so, Terraform will throw an error.

To destroy the instances, you need to follow these steps:

0. **Execute the below to Edit the file**: 

dir
code .


1. **Remove or Comment Out the `lifecycle` Block**: 
   Modify the `main.tf` (or wherever your resource is defined) to either remove or comment out the `lifecycle` block.
   
   ```hcl
   /* lifecycle {
     prevent_destroy = true
   } */
   ```

2. **Run Terraform Apply**: 
   To apply the removal of the `lifecycle` block:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the changes when prompted. This step is necessary because you need to update the Terraform state to reflect the changes you made to the configuration.

3. **Destroy the Resources**:
   Once the `lifecycle` block is removed or commented out, you can destroy the resources:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

   You'll be prompted to confirm the destruction. Type `yes` and press enter. This command will destroy all resources managed by Terraform in the current state. If you only want to destroy the resource groups and not other potential resources, you might consider tainting and then applying, but `terraform destroy` is more straightforward if you're okay with removing all resources.

4. **Re-add the `lifecycle` Block (Optional)**:
   If you plan on recreating the resources and want to keep the `prevent_destroy` behavior for the future, you can now re-add or uncomment the `lifecycle` block and run `terraform apply` again.

Remember to always double-check and backup any data or configurations before destroying resources, especially in production environments.
