 Let's create an example that leverages Input Variables, Output Values, and Local Values to create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet). 

```hcl
# Azure Provider Configuration
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Input Variables
variable "resource_group_name" {
  description = "The name of the Azure Resource Group"
  type        = string
  default     = "my-resource-group"
}

variable "location" {
  description = "The Azure Region in which resources should be created"
  type        = string
  default     = "East US"
}

variable "vnet_name" {
  description = "The name of the Virtual Network"
  type        = string
  default     = "my-vnet"
}

variable "address_space" {
  description = "Address range for the Virtual Network"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}

# Local Values
locals {
  vnet_tags = {
    ManagedBy = "Terraform"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}

# Azure Resource Group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = var.location
}

# Azure Virtual Network
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = var.vnet_name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  address_space       = var.address_space
  tags                = local.vnet_tags
}

# Output Values
output "vnet_id" {
  value       = azurerm_virtual_network.example.id
  description = "The ID of the created Virtual Network"
}

output "vnet_location" {
  value       = azurerm_virtual_network.example.location
  description = "The Azure Region where the Virtual Network is located"
}
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Input Variables**: We have defined input variables for the resource group name, Azure region, virtual network name, and its address space. Users can provide these when calling the Terraform module or use the default values.

2. **Local Values**: A local value `vnet_tags` is created. This is used to assign common tags to the virtual network.

3. **Resource Creation**: We create an Azure Resource Group followed by an Azure Virtual Network within that resource group. We use our input variables and local values in this process.

4. **Output Values**: After creating the Virtual Network, we define output values for the ID and location of the VNet. Users can access these after running `terraform apply`.

To deploy this configuration, users would run `terraform init` followed by `terraform apply`, and Terraform would handle the creation of the Azure resources.




To execute the provided Terraform configuration for creating resources in Azure, follow these steps:

### 1. Setup:

Before running Terraform commands, ensure you've set up your environment:

- Install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).
  
- Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and authenticate using:
  ```bash
  az login
  ```

### 2. Initialize the Terraform Working Directory:

Navigate to the directory containing your Terraform configuration (the `.tf` file).

Initialize the directory with:

```bash
terraform init
```

This command will download the necessary provider plugins (in this case, for Azure) and initialize the directory for use with Terraform.

### 3. Validate and Format the Configuration:

(Optional but recommended) Before applying the configuration, it's a good practice to validate and format your code.

- Validate your configuration:
  ```bash
  terraform validate
  ```

- Format your configuration to ensure it's readable and follows the canonical format:
  ```bash
  terraform fmt
  ```

### 4. Review the Execution Plan:

Before making changes to actual resources, see the "execution plan" to know what Terraform will do:

```bash
terraform plan
```

This command will show you a summary of changes Terraform will make based on your configuration.

### 5. Apply the Configuration:

After reviewing and confirming the execution plan, apply your configuration:

```bash
terraform apply
```

You will be prompted to confirm that you want to create the resources. Type `yes` and press Enter.

### 6. Review Outputs:

Once `terraform apply` completes successfully, you can review the output values (if you've set any in your configuration). In our example, the outputs are `vnet_id` and `vnet_location`.

### 7. Cleanup (Optional):

If you wish to delete the resources you've created (to avoid ongoing charges or to clean up), you can use:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

This command will remove all resources that were created by `terraform apply`.

**Note**: Always ensure you manage and store state files (`terraform.tfstate`) securely. This file contains the state of your resources and is essential for managing and updating your infrastructure. If you're working as a team or in a production environment, consider using [remote backends](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/index.html) like Azure Blob Storage or Terraform Cloud to manage state files.
