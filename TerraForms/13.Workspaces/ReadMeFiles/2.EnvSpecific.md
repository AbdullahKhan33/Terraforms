To execute the Terraform configuration provided in the example, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Terraform:**
   In the root directory of your project (where `main.tf` and `variables.tf` are located), open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to initialize Terraform and download the required provider plugins:

   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

   This command should be executed only once in the project directory or whenever you add or update providers.

2. **Create Workspaces:**
   Create separate workspaces for your different environments (`dev`, `staging`, and `prod`) using the following commands:

   - For the `dev` workspace:

     ```sh
     terraform workspace new dev
     ```

   - For the `staging` workspace:

     ```sh
     terraform workspace new staging
     ```

   - For the `prod` workspace:

     ```sh
     terraform workspace new prod
     ```

   This will create workspace-specific state files and configurations.

3. **Select a Workspace:**
   Use `terraform workspace select` to switch between workspaces as needed. For example, to select the `dev` workspace:

   ```sh
   terraform workspace select dev
   ```

   You can do this for each workspace (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) as required.

4. **Apply Configuration:**
   After selecting the desired workspace, use the `terraform apply` command to apply the configuration for that environment:

   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

   Terraform will create the Azure resources defined in the corresponding `main.tf` file and use the workspace-specific variables from `variables-<environment>.tf`.

5. **Switch Workspaces and Repeat:**
   To switch to a different workspace (e.g., from `dev` to `staging`), use `terraform workspace select` and then run `terraform apply` again. Terraform will apply the configuration for the selected environment.

6. **Destroy Resources (Optional):**
   If needed, you can also use `terraform destroy` to remove the resources created by Terraform. Be cautious with this command, as it will delete resources.

Remember to always be cautious when applying or destroying resources, especially in production environments. It's a good practice to test your Terraform configurations in a non-production environment (e.g., `dev` or `staging`) before applying them to production (`prod`).
